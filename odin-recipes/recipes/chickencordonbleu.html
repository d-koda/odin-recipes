                <div class="list"><ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic powder</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups panko or regular breadcrumbs</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
                    <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (2 1/2 pounds), trimmed of excess fat</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
                    <li>8 slices (about 4 ounces) prosciutto or sliced ham</li>
                    <li>4 ounces Gruyere or Swiss cheese, cut into 1/2-inch thick sticks</li>
                    <li>3 cups vegetable oil, for frying</li>
                </ul></div>

                <div class="list"><ol>
                    <li>In a small mixing bowl, combine the salt, garlic powder, and black pepper. You will use this spice blend later to season the breadcrumbs, flour, and chicken.</li>
                    <li>Prepare your breading station by arranging three shallow dishes in the following order: flour, beaten eggs, breadcrumbs. The breadcrumbs should be closest to your frying pan as that will be the final step in the process before frying. Add the chopped parsley to the dish with the breadcrumbs and stir to mix well. Season both the flour with a 1/2 teaspoon of the spice mixture. Season the breadcrumbs with 1/2 teaspoon of the spice mixture and the chopped fresh parsley. Set these aside while you prepare the chicken breasts. Place a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet and set it aside. This will allow hot air to circulate under the chicken, letting it bake on all sides without the risk of getting soggy.</li>
                    <li>Place the chicken breasts between two pieces of parchment paper and use a meat mallet to flatten them to a 1/4-inch thickness.</li>
                    <li>Slather a teaspoon of mustard onto the flattened chicken breast, then season the meat with a pinch of the spice mixture. Slightly overlap two slices of the prosciutto in the center of the chicken. Place a baton (stick) of Gruyere on top of the prosciutto at one of the longer sides of the chicken.</li>
                    <li>Starting with the cheese side, roll the chicken over the cheese until the meat and cheese are fully encased in the chicken. If you can, try to fold the chicken over the ends of the cheese to prevent the cheese from oozing out during cooking. Use one or two toothpicks to secure the chicken bundle.</li>
                    <li>In a 12-inch skillet set over medium-high heat, bring the oil to 350°F. Heat your oven to 350°F.</li>
                    <li>Lightly dredge the chicken bundles in the flour. Pat off any excess flour, and coat the floured chicken in the egg, allowing excess egg to drip off, then press the chicken bundle into the breadcrumbs to coat it completely.</li>
                    <li>Once your oil is hot, add the chicken to the pan. Fry the chicken for 5 minutes on each side. (You may have to do this in batches. Crowding the pan can reduce the oil’s temperature and leave you with a soggy crust.) Once the chicken breasts have finished frying, drain them on paper towels before transferring them to the cooling rack topped baking sheet, and place them in the oven for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove the chicken from the oven and allow it to rest for 5 minutes before serving. The thrill of a chicken cordon bleu is cutting into the bundle, separating the pieces, and watching that glorious cheese ooze out. Serve the cordon bleu while hot with lemon wedges, mashed potatoes, and a simple green salad.</li>
